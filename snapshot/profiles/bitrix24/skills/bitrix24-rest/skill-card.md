This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

[bitrix24](https://clawhub.ai/user/bitrix24)

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Employees and business operators use this skill to retrieve, summarize, and update Bitrix24 work data through an agent, including CRM records, tasks, meetings, files, chats, customer support conversations, and team status. Administrators configure a dedicated Bitrix24 webhook before use.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The skill can read and modify sensitive Bitrix24 business data, including CRM records, tasks, calendars, chats, files, employee time data, and customer conversations.

Mitigation: Use a dedicated Bitrix24 webhook with only the minimum scopes required and avoid admin-wide permissions.

Risk: Security review found that some paths can change business data without consistently enforcing the confirmation behavior promised by the skill instructions.

Mitigation: Review before installing, and require the publisher to fix batch confirmation enforcement and fail closed on unknown or irregular mutating methods before broad deployment.
